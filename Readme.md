A simple Java gif converter using the Icafe(https://github.com/dragon66/icafe) library

Essentially is the same that a lot of sites do, but without the need to upload the file or save them one by one when the site finishes.

It will split any gif in various JPG images. You can configure in the code what type of extension you want (png, jpg, gif, etc).

This is a very barebones version with a lot of commented code, most of it is working, but i was having difficulties with Swing, the frames would be separated in a way that left blank spots in certain frames. I might expand on this, but honestly, messing with Java image libraries and Swing just isn't worth the hassle. I'll probably remake this in Scala.
