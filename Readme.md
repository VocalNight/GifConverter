A simple Java gif converter using the Icafe(https://github.com/dragon66/icafe) library.

This program will transform any gif into images for you to choose.

Basically a gif to image converter.

The download to a executable Jar file can be found here:

Essentially is the same that a lot of sites do, but without the need to upload the file or save them one by one when the site finishes.

The program will ask for you to find a gif file, after you select it, it will open 2 windows.

The Animation window will display the frames.
The control panel will allow you to navigate all the frames of the gif, allowing you to select the exact frame you want.

After finding the frame you want, press save, you will be able to save anywhere you want.

No need to add the extension, the program takes care of that.

You can configure in the code what type of extension you want (png, jpg, gif, etc).
